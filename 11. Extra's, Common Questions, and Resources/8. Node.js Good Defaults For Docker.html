<p>I tried to keep this course "programming language agnostic", meaning that the things you learn would be just as useful with Java as with PHP or Python. But I do get lots of requests for how best to setup a docker project in language X.</p><p>So to start, I have a <a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/node-docker-good-defaults" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sample project GitHub repo for Node.js</a>, that has a detailed README as well as notes in each file for how you might best setup a Node app in Docker for local development and production use. Any issues or questions you have with it, please use the GitHub Issues for that repo rather than Q&amp;A in this course. Thanks and enjoy!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/node-docker-good-defaults" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/BretFisher/node-docker-good-defaults</a><br></p>
