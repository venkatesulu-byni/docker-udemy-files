<p>I tried to keep this course "programming language agnostic", meaning that the things you learn would be just as useful with Java as with PHP or Python. But I do get lots of requests for how best to setup a docker project in language X.</p>

<p><strong>Here's some resources for PHP developers.</strong></p><p>First, I have my "good defaults" template project here: <a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/php-docker-good-defaults" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/BretFisher/php-docker-good-defaults</a></p><p>If you're a Laravel developer, they have <a href="http://laradock.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laradock</a>, which tries to solve all the docker and docker-compose complexities for PHP developers. The one complaint I get about it, is that it has become quite complex under the hood, but people use it, so give it a shot.</p>
