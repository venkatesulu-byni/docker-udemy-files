<p>You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:</p><p>- <code>docker image prune</code> to clean up just "dangling" images </p><p>- <code>docker system prune</code> will clean up everything</p><p>- The big one is usually <code>docker image prune -a</code> which will remove all images you're not using. Use <code>docker system df</code> to see space usage.</p><p>Remember each one of those commands has options you can learn with <code>--help</code>.</p><p>Here's a YouTube video I made about it: <a href="https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI</a></p><p>Lastly, realize that if you're using Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM won't auto-shrink. You'll need to delete it and re-create (make sure anything in docker containers or volumes are backed up). You can recreate the toolbox default VM with <code>docker-machine rm default</code> and then <code>docker-machine create</code> </p>
