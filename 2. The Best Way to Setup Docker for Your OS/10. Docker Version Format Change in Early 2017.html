<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Versions are now <code>YY.MM</code>  based (like Ubuntu) and you can choose *Stable* (slower) or *Edge* (faster) releases. This means that newer features drop faster in Edge releases, and fixes are backported for a longer timeline to Stable releases. Everyone wins.</p><p>There may be mentions of <code>1.12</code>  and <code>1.13</code>  in this course, which were the two versions before <code>17.03</code> . <code>1.13.1</code>  is actually the same features as <code>17.03.0</code> , so if you see <code>1.13</code>  on my screen recording and <code>17.04</code>  or similar in your CLI, it's fine!</p><p><strong>In 2017 the</strong> <strong>Docker versioning, release cycle, and product names changed, but features haven't.</strong> <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Full details are here</a>, but my commentary on important highlights are below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Docker Engine</strong> (the free one we all know and love) <strong>is now Docker CE</strong> (Community Edition). Notice the drop of the word <em>Engine</em>. I suspect we can just call this Docker now. It includes the cli client and backend daemon/service and api (just like it did before). You can get it the same ways as before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Docker Data Center is now Docker EE</strong> (Enterprise Edition) and adds additional <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?offering=enterprise&amp;type=edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid products and support</a> on top of Docker in three pricing tiers.</p></li><li><p>These changes don't affect Docker Compose or Docker Machine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Docker's version is now </strong><code><strong>YY.MM</strong></code><strong>  based</strong>, using the month of its expected release, and the first one will be <code>17.03.0</code> , which is "the first point release" of the <code>17.03</code>  release. If any bug/security fixes are needed to that release, the first update will be <code>17.03.1</code>  etc.</p></li><li><p>We now have two release tracks (called variants) "Edge" and "Stable". </p><ul><li><p>Edge is released monthly and supported for a month.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Stable is released quarterly and support for 4 months.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You can extend Stable's support and backported fixes through a <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?offering=enterprise&amp;type=edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Docker EE subscription</a>.</p></li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/2017-04-12_05-32-23-54822ca82152a32910290782857f6271/lifecycle.png"></figure>
