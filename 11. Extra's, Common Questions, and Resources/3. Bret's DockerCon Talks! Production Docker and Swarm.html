<p>In 2017 I gave a talk to 5+ conferences about major decisions you needed to make while designing your production Docker solution. You can watch it as "Part 1" below.</p><p>In 2018 I started giving a follow-up talk that goes through deploying many different apps on a single Swarm, and the typical setup and config this might look like for a small team or solo admin in Docker CE and for a big business team in Docker EE.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://dockercon.docker.com/watch/WdAeLaLuSCNQwEp61YVXUt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>DockerCon Part 1: Taking Docker to Production DockerCon EU 2017</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://dockercon2018.hubs.vidyard.com/watch/k3Cv676wmxAwYDxbvcgcgC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>DockerCon Part 2: Building Your Swarm Production Stack DockerCon US 2018</strong></a></p></li></ul><p><strong>In Part 1 </strong>I talk about many of the decisions you need to make when taking your Docker containers from local dev/test to a production cluster. It covers decisions like:</p><ul><li><p>What host OS should I use?</p></li><li><p>What base FROM images should I use?</p></li><li><p>How should my Swarm node design look?</p></li><li><p>What other tools besides Swarm do I need for production containers?</p></li><li><p>What common issues do people have when starting a production docker project?</p></li><li><p>How to limit the project from trying to change too much at once.</p></li><li><p>How to speed up the project by outsourcing small pieces of solution to existing products.</p></li><li><p>How Docker's Enterprise/Cloud products can help.</p></li></ul><p><strong>In Part 2</strong> I cover how to deploy multiple unrelated multi-tier apps to Swarm (and do live demos). We cover using reverse proxy Traefik, including Let's Encrypt certificates, REX-Ray shared storage for persistent data, Prometheus monitoring, ELK logging, and more. All with demos and a <a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/dogvscat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repo full of samples</a>.</p>
