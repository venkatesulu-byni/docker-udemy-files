<p>So you've maybe heard about "Windows Containers". Something that wasn't even possible till mid-2016 in Windows 10 Pro/Ent and not feasible in production with Docker Swarm until April 2017 with a Windows Server 2016 hotfix. <strong>They are awesome, but new!</strong></p>

<p><strong>To be clear, this course so far, even on Windows, is running what we've known as "Docker" for 4 years, which are now called "Linux Containers". </strong></p>



<p>Today Docker is much more than Linux. When you think of images, which are kernel specific, we're now talking about Linux x64, Linux x86 (32-bit), Windows 64bit, and a bunch more. <strong>This course still largely focuses on Linux x64 images because 90% of the concepts are the same</strong>, but "Windows Containers" are the new hotness! Technically, they are Native Windows .exe binaries running in Docker containers on a Windows kernel, and have no Linux installed.</p>



<p>If you check the course Description, I mention at bottom in "Course Launch Notes" about Windows Containers as a future Section I plan to add.  When making this course in 2017, I didn't know anyone really using them because Swarm Overlay networking didn't work on Windows, Secrets didn't work yet, and there were lots of rough edges that people wouldn't find very useful.</p>



<p><strong>But with the release of 17.09 stable, the story for Windows Containers is much better and I plan on a new section for this.</strong> Until then, here's some recent getting started videos from Docker and Microsoft:</p>
