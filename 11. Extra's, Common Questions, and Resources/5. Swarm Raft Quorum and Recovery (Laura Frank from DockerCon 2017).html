<p>Also from DockerCon 2017, fellow Docker Captain and friend <a href="https://twitter.com/rhein_wein" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laura Frank</a> had a great session on the internals of Swarm Managers and how quorum of their Raft log works, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsv-q8WbIZY" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Everything You Thought You Already Knew About Orchestration"</a>. She goes into the math of how you always need an odd number of Managers, and what happens when one or more fail.</p>

<p>She then shows various recovery options in case you "loose quorum" in your Swarm cluster. This video is demo heavy, so it's worth watching the whole thing!</p>
