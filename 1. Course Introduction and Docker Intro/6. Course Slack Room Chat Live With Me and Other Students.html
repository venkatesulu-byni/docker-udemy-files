<p>Slack is a fantastic private, persistent chat product that I use in so many of the communities I'm in, and thought it would be a great way for extending this course and adding more value to your learning. It comes with clients for all desktop and mobile OS's and also works in the browser.</p>



<p><strong>General Steps:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Go to <a href="http://chat.dockermastery.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chat.dockermastery.com</a> and give it your email address.</li><li>You will be sent an email from Slack, with a invite link inside it.</li><li>Click that link.</li><li>Fill out the form to create your Slack account.</li><li>Use that Slack account to access <a href="https://dockermastery.slack.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dockermastery.slack.com</a></li></ol>



<p>(I know that's a lot of steps, but since Udemy doesn't give me your email address, I have no way to pre-create you an account on Slack, and Slack is a invite-only system... so the first step is a way for it to auto-generate an invite for you. :)</p>
